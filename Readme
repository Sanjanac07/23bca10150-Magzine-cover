Introduction
Magazine covers are crucial in grabbing readers' attention and conveying the publication's content and tone. This project involved designing a professional and visually engaging cover for "ESCAPE" magazine, using minimalist design principles to create an appealing and impactful result. Key aspects included image selection, typography, layout, and color schemes.

Techniques Used
- High-Resolution Landscape Photography: A central, high-quality mountain image was selected to highlight the adventurous spirit of the magazine.
- Typography: Bold, clean fonts were used for titles and text elements to maintain readability and a modern aesthetic.
- Layer Masking and Shape Tools: A torn-paper effect was created on the header and footer using layer masks, adding a unique, organic look.
- Color Adjustments and Contrast: Brightness and contrast of the background image were adjusted to harmonize the design elements and ensure text readability.
- Alignment and Spacing: All elements were carefully aligned to create a cohesive, structured layout.

Operating System Compatibility
This project was completed using Adobe Photoshop, which is compatible across multiple operating systems:
- Windows: Supported on Windows 10 and above, suitable for both professional and home use.
- macOS: Available on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later versions, providing robust design tools for Mac users.

Process
- Canvas Setup: A new document was created in Adobe Photoshop with dimensions of 8.5 x 11 inches at 300 DPI for high print quality.
- Background Image: A high-quality mountain landscape was imported and scaled to fill the canvas, making it the focal point of the design.
- Design Elements:
- Header and Footer Bars: Black bars were added at the top and bottom for text placement, creating strong contrast.
- Torn Edge Effect: Applied using layer masks, giving a rugged, natural touch that complements the adventure theme.
- Text Placement:
- Magazine Title ("ESCAPE"): Positioned prominently in a bold, sans-serif font.
- Issue Details: Placed in a smaller, lighter font above the title for additional information.
- Main Title and Subtitle: Centered and styled for maximum impact.
- Website URL: Minimalist placement in the footer for a clean look.
- Final Adjustments: Tweaked font sizes, alignments, and text spacing for visual balance. Adjusted image brightness and contrast for clear text visibility.
- Export: The final design was exported in high-resolution formats (JPEG/PNG) for both print and digital platforms.
